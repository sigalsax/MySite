					<p>&emsp;In addition to my academics, I have a diversified background in programming, development, and design. This past summer I worked for CyberArk Software Inc. as an Information Security Services Intern. Here, I developed and designed a UI-based program featured in the 2017 CyberArk IMPACT Conference for over 1,000 customers, employees, and partners using the .NET Framework and C#. I had never programmed in C# but chose to do so because after some research, I thought its UI capability would be far more expressive than Javaâ€™s. With every iteration, I worked tirelessly, beating the deadlines, forcing myself to be uncomfortable but ultimately trusting my abilities to navigate the obstacles as they came. Currently at Conjur Inc., I am a Software Engineer Intern, building, designing, and maintaining their Ruby-backed public facing website. The opportunities I have pursued and continue to pursue have reinforced my programming abilities, and have afforded me the confidence and autonomy to seek out and learn new web technologies.</p><br>
					<p>&emsp;For my most recent project, I have utilized what I have learned through academia and side-projects and tapped into my entrepreneurial spirit to build my idea from concept to market. The idea for my most recent project stemmed from the realization that there was a hole in the e-gaming market. Only the top, professional video gamers play for profit and perks, leaving the rest of the market untouched. This is what led me to co-found Intraleagues, a platform that offers gamers an opportunity to build a cohesive network and game with peers in their area for both fun and profit. I was responsible for outreach, staging, and development of the website. By the end of six months, we had 70 active users, three leagues, and competed for and won angel seed money to continue to build our user base and extend our reach. After such a successful term, I have since turned to consulting young startups in the New England area on how to achieve their own end of term goals, turning their ideas to successful businesses.</p>
