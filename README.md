# **MySite (Coarse Coding):**
repo of my site (not live)

## **Purpose:**
I created this website as a form of self-experimentation for JS, HTML, and CSS while also allowing viewers to view past and current projects.  

## **Future Implementations:**
I am currently working on integrating Node and React into this project.
